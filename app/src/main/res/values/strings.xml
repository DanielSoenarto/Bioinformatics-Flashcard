    <string name="text_what_is_bioinfo">Bioinformatics involves computer technology to store and analyze biological data such as DNA/amino acid sequences. \n\nScientists use databases to collect and organize biological information in order to better understand health, diseases, and gain insights. \n\nNow, Bioinformaticians are left to understand and interpret the big amount of data that has been collected by the aid of computers.\n\n(Adams, 2022)</string>
